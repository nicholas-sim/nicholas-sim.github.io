This <a href="https://nicholas-sim.github.io/ANL501-Data-Visualisation-and-Storytelling/">course</a>  the principles of Grammar of Graphics to create data visualizations for storytelling with R as the primary tool. It begins by covering the fundamentals of R programming and data wrangling using both base R and _dplyr_ from the _tidyverse_ package. The course delves into the application of the _ggplot2_ package to construct various visualizations suitable for different data types, including bar plots, Cleveland dot plots, jitter plots, boxplots, line plots, area plots, path plots, tree maps, choropleth maps, and more. Emphasis is placed on the importance of data preprocessing such as reshaping and pivoting to achieve desired plots. Finally, the course focuses on teaching how to incorporate data storytelling elements to create compelling visualizations and covers the use of RMarkdown and data APIs for automation of data processing and analytics processes and the crafting of reproducible reports.
