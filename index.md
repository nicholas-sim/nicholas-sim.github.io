Welcome! I am an economist by training and I teach at the <a href="https://www.suss.edu.sg/"> Singapore University of Social Sciences </a>. I received my doctoral education from the <a href="https://www.bc.edu/bc-web/schools/morrissey/departments/economics.html"> economics department at Boston College </a> and spent about 9 years as a faculty member at the <a href="https://able.adelaide.edu.au/economics-and-public-policy/"> School of Economics, University of Adelaide </a> before returning to Singapore. This page serves as a repository for students in my course who may wish to reference the materials in the future.


## Research

I work mainly in applied econometrics.

## Teaching

I developed the  <a href="https://www.suss.edu.sg/programmes/detail/mavi">Master and Graduate Diploma in Analytics and Visualisation</a> programme at SUSS and served as the Head of Programme (until 1 July 2024). Here are the courses I am teaching or have taught in the programme.


 <a  style="font-weight:bold" href="https://nicholas-sim.github.io/ANL501-Data-Visualisation-and-Storytelling/">ANL501 Data Visualisation and Storytelling</a>

This <a href="https://nicholas-sim.github.io/ANL501-Data-Visualisation-and-Storytelling/">course</a> adopts the principles of Grammar of Graphics to create data visualizations for storytelling with R as the primary tool. We will delve into the application of the _ggplot2_ package to construct various visualizations to present different data types, such as bar plots, dot plots, jitter plots, boxplots, line plots, area plots, path plots, tree maps, choropleth maps, and more. mastering the use of Grammar of Graphics layers to create data visualizations conducive to effective storytelling, along with developing data preprocessing skills essential for achieving desired plots. Finally, we will explore the use of RMarkdown and data APIs for automating back-end data extraction, data wrangling, and analytics when crafting of reproducible reports.
