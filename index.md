I developed the  <a href="https://www.suss.edu.sg/programmes/detail/mavi">Master and Graduate Diploma in Analytics and Visualisation</a> programme at SUSS and served as the Head of Programme until 1 July 2024. Here are the courses I am teaching or have taught in the programme.

## ANL501 Data Visualisation and Storytelling 

This <a href="https://nicholas-sim.github.io/ANL501-Data-Visualisation-and-Storytelling/">course</a> uses principles of **Grammar of Graphics** to construct data visualisation for storytelling. R will be used throughot. The course first covers the fundamentals of R programming and data wrangling using both base R and _dyplr_ from the  _tidyverse_ package. The course then explores the application of the _gpplot2_ package to construct various data visualisations suitable for different data types. Visualisations such as bar plots, Cleveland point plots, jitter plots, boxplots, line plots, path plots, tree maps, choropleth maps, etc. will be explored.
