I developed the ![Master of Analytics and Visualisation](https://www.suss.edu.sg/programmes/detail/mavi) programme at SUSS and headed the programme until 1 July 2024. Here are the courses I am teaching or have taught in the programme.

## ANL501 Data Visualisation and Storytelling 

This <a href="https://nicholas-sim.github.io/ANL501-Data-Visualisation-and-Storytelling/">course</a> uses principles of the Grammar of Graphics to construct data visualisation for storytelling. R will be used throughot. The course first covers the fundamentals of R programming and the use of base R and tidyverse for data wrangling. The course then explores the application of the gpplot2 package to construct various data visualisations for different data types.
