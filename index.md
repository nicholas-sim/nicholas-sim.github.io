## Research

I work mainly in applied econometrics.

## Teaching

I developed the  <a href="https://www.suss.edu.sg/programmes/detail/mavi">Master and Graduate Diploma in Analytics and Visualisation</a> programme at SUSS and served as the Head of Programme (until 1 July 2024). Here are the courses I am teaching or have taught in the programme.


 <a  style="font-weight:bold" href="https://nicholas-sim.github.io/ANL501-Data-Visualisation-and-Storytelling/">ANL501 Data Visualisation and Storytelling</a>

This <a href="https://nicholas-sim.github.io/ANL501-Data-Visualisation-and-Storytelling/">course</a> adopts the principles of Grammar of Graphics to create data visualizations for storytelling with R as the primary tool. It begins by covering the fundamentals of R programming and data wrangling using both base R and _dplyr_ from the _tidyverse_ package. The course delves into the application of the _ggplot2_ package to construct various visualizations to present different data types, such as bar plots, dot plots, jitter plots, boxplots, line plots, area plots, path plots, tree maps, choropleth maps, and more. Emphasis is placed on the use of Grammar of Graphics layers to create data visualisations for data storytelling and the development of data preprocessing skills to achieve the desired plots. Finally, the covers the use of RMarkdown and data APIs for the automation of data processing and analytics processes when crafting of reproducible reports.
